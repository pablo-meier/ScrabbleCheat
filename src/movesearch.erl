-module(movesearch).

%% The 'meat' of the program, takes a board and a rack and generates the best
%% move for that player given its inputs.  The logical progression goes
%% something like this:
%%
%% Board -> [Candidate] 
%% 
%% From the board you get a list of candidates.  This is pretty much all squares
%% adjacent to a square already in play.
%%
%% Candidate * Rack -> [Move]
%%
%% From the Candidate, you generate all the possible moves that you can 'latch'
%% onto that candidate with your given rack.  This generates ALL the moves, we
%% can shrink it down later.
%%
%% [Move] * Board -> Move
%%
%% We then take all the moves we've generated and test them against each other
%% for fitness, and pick the best one.

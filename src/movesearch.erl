%% The 'meat' of the program, takes a board and a rack and generates the best

%% something like this:
%%
%% get_move_candidate_locations :: Board -> [Candidate] 
%% 
%% From the board you get a list of candidates.  This is pretty much all squares
%% adjacent to a square already in play.
%%
%% find_all_moves :: Candidate * Rack * Board * Gaddag -> [Move]
%%
%% From the Candidate, you generate all the possible moves that you can 'latch'
%% onto that candidate with your given rack.  This generates ALL the moves, we
%% can shrink it down later.
%%
%% get_best_move :: [Move] * Board -> Move
%%
%% We then take all the moves we've generated and test them against each other
%% for fitness, and pick the best one.
%%
%% Each of these steps requires lots of helpers; the functions are grouped 
%% according to these steps, and have header comments seperating them.

%% find_all_moves :: Candidate * Rack * Board -> [Move]
%%
%% The 'meat' of the search, uses the Gaddag to traverse the board for possible
%% moves.  This relies on a very tangled recursive subroutine, may God have 
%% mercy on us all.
%%
%% 'Zoomtile' is described best as the furthest tile to the right of the 'line' 
%% you are investigating.  Supposing you have ABLE, and you are investigating
%% the space to the left of 'A'.  When you hit the separator character on the
%% GADDAG, you need to know to continue forward past E, and furthermore, that
%% your word should contain all of ABLE, not just A.  So TABLEMAKER can be made
%% by assigning the ZoomTile to E ("zooming" to the right as far as you can), 
%% traversing the GADDAG through the string 'ELBA'.  
%%
%% At that point the recursive routine can pick T from your rack and GADDAG, 
%% find the seperator, and 'jump' past the ZoomTile to complete the word 
%% (MAKER).  The idea is that you begin each search of a candidate square by
%% 'zooming' as far forward as you can, and using the Gaddag to find your way
%% back, THEN traversing the GADDAG greedily using backtracking and 
%% accumulators to slowly build up a move.

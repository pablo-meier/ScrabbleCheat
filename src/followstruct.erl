%% An intermediate data type for the construction of moves.  A 'followstruct'
%% contains all the information you need to 'follow along' the GADDAG and board.
%% It consists of 
%%    - A Tile, where you are currently situated.
%%    - A Direction, where you are headed.
%%    - A Gaddag, which you use to traverse.
%%    - A Board, which you frequently reference.
%%    - A Move, which we are currently adding tiles to.

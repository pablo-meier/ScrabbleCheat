- Generalize the board and board parser to take different default 
  configurations, such as a Lexulous board, or a custom board.  The hard-coding
  is more a result of the fact that I'm in a place with no internet and can't 
  consult the Regex library, and also because this is slightly easier.  This will
  mostly involve changing the new_board to parse the board in lib/, and changing
  the BOARD_HEIGHT and BOARD_LENGTH constants to read from that file as well.

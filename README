ScrabbleCheat
=============

Revenge of the Verbally Challenged
----------------------------------

ScrabbleCheat is a tool I'm developing to finally beat my girlfriend in Scrabble.
Developing it in Erlang, mostly for fun.  Use it yourself, or explore the code!

We'll do this in phases;  First we build a word-generator, which will efficiently 
find candidate words based on collections of letters.  This has mostly been completed, 
and running the program ('make run') has a bare text interface to generate combinations.

The next phase is to model the actual Scrabble board with scoring, then designing
an algorithm to find the (an?) optimal move.

###Contents

ScrabbleCheat has the following contents:

* Makefile -> Builds the project, targets below.
* src/ -> Contains the .erl source files.
* lib/ -> Contains any extraneous support, such as testing macros or dictionary files.
* test/ -> Contains unit tests for each of the modules, some rigorous, some not.

###Makefile

The Makefile has the following targets:

* test (default) -> Compiles the project and runs the Unit tests.
* run -> Opens a bare client in your terminal: you to enter characters and receive words.
* shell -> Compiles the project and loads the definitions into an Erlang shell.
* clean -> Removes all compilation bits.
* compile -> Builds the project and stores the .beam files into build/
* compile-test -> Builds the Unit tests.

For now this is just loose code that will hopefully piece together into actual usable software; 
in the meantime, I'm putting it here as well as my local machine.  Enjoy, and email
about any questions, concerns!

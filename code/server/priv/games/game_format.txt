GAME DIRECTORIES
================

In adding support for games other than Scrabble, each game has its quirks
represented by a common file structure.  For a game to be valid, it requires the
following files with the appropriate specified structure:

-----------------
allowed_dicts.txt ->
    This is a list of dictionaries the game allows, one per line.  Dictionaries
are either:

    * twl06   -> Standard TWL Scrabble Dictionary.
    * sowpods -> The International Dictionary.
    * zynga   -> The one Zynga invented for Words With Friends.


---------------
bingo_bonuses.txt ->
    Every game has a different way of rewarding players who use most/all of the
tiles on their rack.  Scrabble has a 7-tile rack, and if you use all 7, you get
an extra 50 points!

    Leave it to the pirates of Lexulous to complicate things. To avoid copyright
infringement, they modified the rules of their derivative game, giving players a
rack of 8. Now you have to types of bonuses: one for playing 7 tiles, and
another for playing all 8. For this reason, rather than being a number, you
specify the bonuses as a mapping, such as:

7 - 50
8 - 100

    Meaning, if you put 7 tiles down, you get a bonus 50 points.  If you drop 8,
you get a bonus of 100.

-----------------
board.txt ->
    This is a template board for the game.  The tiles are specified as follows:

    * N -> Normal
    * TL -> Triple Letter Score
    * DL -> Double Letter Score
    * TW -> Triple Word Score
    * DW -> Double Word Score.

-----------------
letterdist.txt
    All these games have different distributions of letters: some have 3 H
tiles, some have 4. Just list each letter with how many of that tile exist, such
as

A - 7
B - 2
C - 3
...
Y - 2
Z - 1
* - 2

    Remember the *!  That's your wildcard.

-----------------
points.txt
    Like letterdist, each game assigns a separate mapping of letter to points.
Same format (in this case, A is worth 1 point, B is worth 3...)

A - 1
B - 3
...
Z - 10
* - 0


-----------------
rack_size.txt
    Just a number.  This is the max number of tiles in your rack.

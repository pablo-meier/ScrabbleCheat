What the hell is this?!?
------------------------

Erlang's Thrift bindings don't support HTTP servers -- only the 'Basic' server,
which is to say, communication through sockets on a local machine.  Until I
or someone else augments the Thrift bindings to use something like mochiweb,
ScrabbleCheat will only work for clients that are local, which makes most
client use a bit of a hassle.

This little wrapper will allows ScrabbleCheat to serve HTTP ports by using 
Thrift language bindings which support HTTP (the C++ ones), and just forward 
messages to and from the Erlang implementation.


Isn't this technically a client, since it uses/relies on the server?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great observation!  There was some internal debate whether or not to include 
this with the server, or just call it a 'client' who's only purpose is to 
facilitate HTTP calls. I may move it to the client implementations yet!

However, for now, I'm considering HTTP support one of the core, necessary 
features for this server, and with that idea in mind, we'll keep it here.

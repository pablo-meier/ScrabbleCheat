%% A gamestate is the current state of the game between some players.  It's 
%% one of the things the server and clients pass around to each other when 
%% they're deciding what to do, and allow someone to recreate the game entirely.
%%
%% It is composed of 
%%   -  A board, with all the current tiles on it. :: Board
%%   -  The players' scores. :: [{String, Int}]
%%   -  A player whose turn it is :: String
%%   -  A game history :: [{Player, Move, Score}]
%%
%% This factors heavily into the MVC separation:  most of the controller code
%% (that on the Erlang side) will communicate to any View by serializing these
%% objects and passing them around, and save their state correspondingly.

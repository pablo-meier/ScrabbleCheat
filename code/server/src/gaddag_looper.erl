%% Module with logic for the process that stores operations on the GADDAG.  
%% Before we managed all things to do with the GADDAG (board/gamestate/move
%% correctness verification, creation of word functions) in ETS tables, but
%% this proved troublesome, since large binaries are copied into the 
%% processor

%% State is a simple orddict that with keys sowpods, twl06, or zynga.  The 
%% values are the GADDAGs.



%% Note that we initialize the GADDAGs in start_link rather than init()
%% because the spawning process (scrabblecheat_main) needs to wait until
%% the the GADDAG is loaded before it receives requests for the rest of
%% it's functionality.
%%
%% It's a total hack. We're passing the Gaddag to init() via the third
%% parameter of gen_server:start_link, and init will pretty much just return
%% it.

# Scrabblecheat Elm client

Learning Elm with my favorite learning project. It's got two components:

* Node.js server that communicates to ScrabbleCheat with Thrift. I have no love
  in my heart for Node but that's not the focus of the project and I can hack
  away at this quickly.

* Elm SPA that communicates with the Node to provide a **R I C H**
  **C L I E N T** **E X P E R I E N C E**.

I just finished [this Elm tutorial app][1] so will follow its example(s) and
structure.

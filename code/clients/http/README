What the hell is this?!?
------------------------

Erlang's Thrift bindings don't support HTTP servers -- only the 'Basic' server,
which is to say, communication through sockets on a local machine.  Until I
or someone else augments the Thrift bindings to use something like mochiweb,
ScrabbleCheat will only work for clients that are local, which makes most
client use a bit of a hassle, especially if we want to deploy as a webapp.

This little wrapper will allows ScrabbleCheat to serve HTTP ports by using 
Thrift language bindings which support HTTP (the C++ ones), and just forward 
messages to and from the Erlang implementation.
